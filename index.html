		I have mapped some of the most viewed and significant sporting events that occur internationally. There is a wide variety of events, infrastructure, and politics surrounding the locations in which these events are held. The wide variety also showcases that sporting events are a meaningful way to connect groups of people despite varied backgrounds, interests, and locations.
		</p>
		Each of these events generates millions of viewers, social media posts, and impressions and are very culturally significant.
